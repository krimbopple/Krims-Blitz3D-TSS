### Features
- DirectX 9 rendering support
- New ImGui-based IDE & Debugger replacing the legacy editors.
- Debugger runs as a separate process for better performance, and now has expandable arrays in variable trees.
- Built-in profiler with per-function timing, call counts, memory statistics, and a flame graph for identifying performance bottlenecks.
- [New scene system with commands for creating, switching, clearing, and querying scenes.](https://github.com/krimbopple/BlitzX3D/wiki/New-Commands#createscene--setscene--clearscene--getcurrentscene)
- Async texture loading, dramatically reducing boot and loading times.
- Improved rendering performance through render-state batching, draw-call sorting, brush-bucketed rendering, and faster font lookups.
- [Improved shader support, including .fx effects, runtime effect textures, and per-frame shader parameters.](https://github.com/krimbopple/BlitzX3D/wiki/New-Commands#loadeffect--setentityeffect--setbrusheffect)
- Better render-target control with SetBufferDepth and RenderEntity.
- Improved texture handling, including automatic alpha detection, animated texture grids, mipmapped filtering, cubemap fixes, and better transparency handling.
- Upgraded audio system now powered by BASS for improved compatibility, stability, and sound quality.

## How to Build

### Prepare

- Visual Studio Community 2022
  - Desktop development with C++
  - C++ MFC for latest v143 build tools (x86 & x64)
  - C++ ATL for latest v143 build tools (x86 & x64)
  - ASP.NET and web development
- This repo vendors [SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) as a **git submodule**. After cloning, initialize it before building:
  ```sh
  git submodule update --init
  ```
  (Or clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules`.) SDL3 is linked statically, so no `SDL3.dll` needs to be shipped alongside the builds.

### Before building `linker` or `bbruntime_dll`:

1. Copy `linker/cryptseed.h.example` to `linker/cryptseed.h`.
2. Open `cryptseed.h` and change `RUNTIME_KEY_SEED` to any nonzero value of your own choosing.
   
### Steps

1. Open `blitz3d.sln` in Visual Studio 2022.
2. Select the **Release**/**Debug** configuration and rebuild the entire solution.
3. All done! You can find the output files in the `_release` and `_release/bin` directories. Feel free to delete any `.pdb` and `.ilk` files.

## Properly Debugging

Because the launcher (`bblaunch`) spawns the IDE (`ide.exe`) and then exits, Visual Studio will lose the debug session by default. To debug properly:

1. Install the **Microsoft Child Process Debugging Power Tool 2022+** from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsdbgplat.MicrosoftChildProcessDebuggingPowerTool2022).
2. In Visual Studio, go to **Debug -> Other Debug Targets -> Child Process Debugging Settings** and enable **"Enable child process debugging"**.

The debugger will now automatically attach to `ide.exe` when it launches, and you will now be able to properly debug your programs!
